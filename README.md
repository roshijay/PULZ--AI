# PULZ-AI: Social Media Trend Analyst

---

## Project Overview

**PULZ-AI** is an intelligent trend analysis tool that helps creators, marketers, and businesses understand what drives video viralityâ€”and how to optimize content for maximum impact.

Leveraging **machine learning**, **natural language processing**, and **data visualization**, PULZ-AI analyzes video metadata like titles, descriptions, hashtags, engagement metrics, and post timing to:

* **Predict virality**: Identify content likely to gain significant traction.
* **Identify emerging trends**: Pinpoint hot topics and effective content patterns.
* **Offer actionable recommendations**: Provide personalized advice via a chatbot-style interface.

Whether you're growing a YouTube channel or optimizing marketing campaigns, PULZ-AI empowers you to make data-driven content decisions.

## Key Features

* **Virality Prediction**
    * Predict whether a post is likely to go viral using robust models like XGBoost or Random Forest.
* **Trend Identification**
    * Analyze titles and hashtags using advanced NLP techniques (e.g., TF-IDF, BERT) to detect patterns and popular topics.
* **Conversational AI Interface**
    * A chatbot-style assistant (built with Streamlit/Gradio and potentially integrated LLMs) to provide personalized, interactive suggestions.
* **Interactive Visualizations**
    * Explore dynamic dashboards and insightful graphs using powerful tools like Plotly and Tableau to understand trends and model outputs.
* **SQL-Powered Data Handling**
    * Perform efficient feature engineering, data extraction, and wrangling with SQL (e.g., SQLite for local data management).

## Technologies & Tools

* **Languages**: Python, SQL
* **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Pandas, NumPy
* **Natural Language Processing**: Hugging Face Transformers (DistilBERT), NLTK, spaCy
* **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Tableau (for external dashboards)
* **Web Framework/App**: Streamlit (for the interactive chatbot UI)
* **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
* **Containerization**: Docker (for potential future deployment)
* **Database**: SQLite (for local SQL practice/data storage)

## ðŸ’¡ How to Run (Local Setup)

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/roshijay/PULZ-ai.git](https://github.com/roshijay/PULZ-ai.git)
    cd PULZ-ai
    ```
2.  **Create a virtual environment** (recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Explore notebooks**: Dive into the `notebooks/` directory to see the data analysis and model development steps.
5.  **Run the Streamlit app**:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app/chatbot.py
    ```
    *(Note: The `app/chatbot.py` will be developed as the project progresses.)*

## Future Enhancements

* Integration with live social media APIs (e.g., YouTube Data API, if feasible).
* Expansion to other social media platforms (Instagram, TikTok).
* Personalized content generation suggestions (e.g., draft title ideas).
* More advanced LLM integration for nuanced conversational insights.

## ðŸ’¬ Example Use Case

```plaintext
User: "Is this YouTube title good? 'Top 10 Time-Saving Tips for Creators'"

PULZ-AI: "Great start! Adding urgency (e.g., 'that will change your routine') could improve click-through rates. Also, our analysis shows 8â€“12 word titles with a number perform best in your niche."
